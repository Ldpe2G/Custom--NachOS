==============

This project is based on the nachos 4.1 which is transplanted to windows, and than split into two parts 

including :

1, the MIPS Virtual Machine part, under the MIPSVirtualMachine folder, a win32 console project.                                                 
2, the Operating system part, under the NachOsDll folder, a dll project.

than loaded by the virtual mahine part.


The goal is to better simulate the development of the operating system and make the extension more easily.
